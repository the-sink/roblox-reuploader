# Roblox Bulk Reupload Tool [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/the-sink/roblox-reuploader)](https://github.com/the-sink/roblox-reuploader/blob/main/LICENSE) [![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/the-sink/roblox-reuploader)](https://github.com/the-sink/roblox-reuploader/issues)

As many are already well aware of, [Roblox is making it so that audio above 6 seconds can only be used if you are the uploader](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/action-needed-upcoming-changes-to-asset-privacy-for-audio/1701697) on March 22nd 2022. This tool's objective is to ease the process of transitioning your game over, by automatically collecting all audio that requires migration and automatically re-uploading it into your profile (or the group, if you're running this in a group game).

# Warnings
**THIS TOOL IS EXPERIMENTAL!** I developed it fairly quickly and have not had ample opportunities yet to thoroughly test it. If you are migrating a game with a lot of audio assets, please closely monitor the profile that audio is being uploaded to and ensure nothing is going wrong.

**Make sure you have the quota available to upload all of the audio.** Another change as a result of this is that audio uploads are now free - but every user has a monthly quota that is dependent on a few factors (such as whether you are ID verified). You can check your quota by visiting the audio upload page on the website. The plugin will display the **maximum** total number of assets it intends to upload on-screen and will require you to confirm this. Keep in mind, this number is not *neccesarily* the final amount of assets that will be uploaded, as it keeps a running list of all of the assets it has previously uploaded (these are used instead of uploading duplicates). Invalid/copyrighted assets and HTTP errors can affect this as well, of course.
